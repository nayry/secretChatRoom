# secretChatRoom
This is a very simple real-time chat web application buile with React and Socket.io. I call it the Secret Chat Room. 
The reason for the “Secret” is that anyone can create a chat room without disclosing any personal information. 
And other people can join a chat room using the room code generated at the top and start chatting. 
Zero personal information is disclosed at any time. Everyone can just chat anonymously.
